This repository contains insights derived from the analysis of 7,134 vehicles in order to understand the quantity of CO2 emissions. The analysis takes into consideration various variables, including fuel type, vehicle class, engine size, and number of cylinders.

## CO2 Emissions Overview

Total number of vehicles analyzed: 7,134
Average CO2 emissions (g/km): 250.59
Note: The average CO2 emissions are above the normal range and require high attention. The European Commission's target by 2024 is to reach emission levels of 95g CO2/km for cars and 147g CO2/km for vans.
## Highest and Lowest Polluting Vehicles

The analysis revealed significant differences in CO2 emissions among different vehicle types:

Highest polluting vehicles:

Supercars and passenger vans recorded the highest CO2 emissions, with a staggering figure of more than 400g CO2/km.
Lowest polluting vehicles:

Hybrid vehicles, such as Ioniq, Prius, Corolla from Toyota, and Hyundai, exhibited significantly lower CO2 emissions, measuring less than 100g CO2/km.
## Contribution of Vehicle Models

Among the various vehicle manufacturers, the following models were identified as significant contributors to CO2 emissions:

Mercedes
BMW
Ford
Chevrolet

## Fuel Types and Usage

In terms of fuel types, the analysis revealed the following insights:

Premium Gasoline and Regular Gasoline were the most commonly used fuels among the top 100 polluting vehicles.

# Project-4
##Project Title
Prediction of Carbon Emissions in Canada by car properties

## Description and objectives
To Relationship between car properties and carbon emission.
Correlation between car properties and carbon emission.
Presenting machine learning models to predict the carbon emissions from known properties of cars according to the availble data.

## Activities carried out
- Presentation and visusualization of availed data on tableau
- Clustering through unsupervised learning
- Multiple linear regression using Supervised Machine Learning
- Binary clasification using deep learning

## Conclusions
- Exploring the data through “Tableu” we identified the relationships between car properties and “CO2 Emissions”, such as identifying average CO2 Emission according to car model or finding most polluting fuel types..etc
- Using similarities in data we have created sample clusters according to CO Emissions and Fuel Consumptions. Considering the purpose of an analysis more clusters can be done by changing the variables in the data.
- We used Canada’s cars and CO2 emissions data and our models have created valuable outcomes with high accuracy. So, they can be used for making predictions in the same topic in different data sets with similar accuracy.
- However, during Logistics Regression modelling in Deep Learning we realized that the task is not too complex for deep learning since it reaches the high accuracy with min epoch and even without in need of a second layer. Thus, instead of using Deep Learning, supervised Machine Learning application can be well enough for this type of task and linear model – data relationship.

# Project-4
##Project Title
Prediction of Carbon Emissions in Canada by car properties

## Description and objectives
To Relationship between car properties and carbon emission.
Correlation between car properties and carbon emission.
Presenting machine learning models to predict the carbon emissions from known properties of cars according to the availble data.

## Activities carried out
- Presentation and visusualization of availed data on tableau
- Clustering through unsupervised learning
- Multiple regression using Supervised Machine Learning
- Binary clasification using deep learning

## Conclusions
- Exploring the data through “Tableu” we identified the relationships between car properties and “CO2 Emissions”, such as identifying average CO2 Emission according to car model or finding most polluting fuel types..etc
- Using similarities in data we have created sample clusters according to CO Emissions and Fuel Consumptions. Considering the purpose of an analysis more clusters can be done by changing the variables in the data.
- We used Canada’s cars and CO2 emissions data and our models have created valuable outcomes with high accuracy. So, they can be used for making predictions in the same topic in different data sets with similar accuracy.
- However, during Logistics Regression modelling in Deep Learning we realized that the task is not too complex for deep learning since it reaches the high accuracy with min epoch and even without in need of a second layer. Thus, instead of using Deep Learning, supervised Machine Learning application can be well enough for this type of task and linear model – data relationship.
